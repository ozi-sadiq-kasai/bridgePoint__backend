First, Iâ€™m really sorry you and your kids have gone through this. Given the history of abuse and abandonment, you have strong grounds to argue against shared custody, especially full holidays. Here are key points to focus on:  

### **1. Emphasize His Abandonment and Lack of Contact**  
- He has been absent for **7 years**â€”no financial, emotional, or physical support.  
- He made **zero effort** to check on their well-being, provide for them, or build a relationship.  
- The children didnâ€™t even know he existed until **two weeks ago**â€”a sudden reappearance can be traumatic.  

### **2. Highlight the History of Domestic Violence**  
- Provide proof or testimony about the **physical abuse** you endured, especially how he threw you and the children out.  
- Emphasize that this creates **safety concerns**â€”if he was violent toward you, he could be violent toward the kids.  
- If you have **police reports, medical records, or witness statements**, they will strengthen your case.  

### **3. Address the Best Interests of the Children**  
- Courts prioritize **what is best for the children**, not what the father wants.  
- Sudden forced visits, especially for long durations (like holidays), can be **emotionally damaging** since they donâ€™t know him.  
- Their entire stabilityâ€”**school, emotional well-being, and routines**â€”would be disrupted.  

### **4. Challenge His Demand for Holiday Time**  
- Holidays are a time for **comfort and familiarity**, not being forced to spend time with a stranger.  
- If the court insists on visitation, it should be **gradual and supervised** to assess his ability to be a responsible parent.  

### **5. If Possible, Request Supervised Visitation**  
- If the court still wants to grant him access, push for **supervised visits in a controlled environment** until he proves he is a fit parent.  
- Ask for therapy or parenting classes for him before considering any unsupervised custody.  

### **6. Financial Responsibility**  
- Has he paid child support? If not, point out that he has provided **zero financial assistance** in 7 years.  
- If he wants a role now, he should **prove he can support them**, not just demand time.  

### **Legal Support**  
If you donâ€™t already have a lawyer, **get one** as soon as possible. They can help present your case effectively. If finances are tight, check for **legal aid services** in your area that assist single mothers in custody battles.  

Would you like help drafting a statement for court?
Thatâ€™s a good startâ€”supervised visitation ensures your childrenâ€™s safety while the court assesses the situation. Since he hasnâ€™t paid a dime in **seven years**, that further weakens his case for shared custody. Hereâ€™s how you can continue strengthening your argument for **sole custody or very limited visitation**:  

---

### **1. Emphasize His Financial Neglect**  
- He has not contributed **financially or emotionally** for **seven years**.  
- Courts expect both parents to be responsibleâ€”**a parent who abandons their financial duty for years is not fit for custody.**  
- If he truly cared, he would have **paid child support** or at least tried to help in some way.  

ðŸ“Œ **Action:** If possible, request **back child support**. Even if you donâ€™t care about the money, this forces the court to see how little he has done.  

---

### **2. Argue Against Shared Custody or Holiday Visits**  
- **Sudden presence**: The children just found out about him **two weeks ago**. A stranger should not get **immediate shared custody** or full holiday time.  
- **Emotional distress**: The court should consider the **mental and emotional impact** of suddenly forcing them to bond with someone they donâ€™t know.  
- **Inconsistent parenting**: He has not been around to provide stability, discipline, or guidance.  
- **Potential safety risks**: If he was violent before, the court must ensure he has changed before granting **any unsupervised access**.  

ðŸ“Œ **Action:** Ask the court to **gradually** introduce visitation if they insist on itâ€”this could mean **short, supervised sessions over time**, rather than immediate custody or long visits.  

---

### **3. Demand Proof of His Ability to Parent**  
Since he was abusive and absent, he must **prove** that he is fit to be a father before being granted any custody. You can request:  
âœ” **Therapy** for him and the kids to ensure a safe transition.  
âœ” **Parenting classes** to prove he is learning how to care for them.  
âœ” **Drug/alcohol tests** if there are concerns about substance abuse.  
âœ” **Anger management classes** due to his past violence.  

---

### **4. Keep the Supervised Visitation in Place**  
- If he shows **any red flags** (anger, manipulation, trying to alienate the kids from you), document everything.  
- If the kids feel uncomfortable or scared around him, this can be used to adjust the visitation terms.  
- Courts do not **rush** reunification when a parent has been gone this long. Use this period to prove he is not fit for more access.  

---

### **5. Consider a Guardian ad Litem (GAL)**  
This is a **neutral party assigned by the court** to determine what is in the best interest of the kids. A GAL can help:  
- Assess whether visits are **emotionally healthy** for the children.  
- Recommend **limiting or removing visitation** if the kids are distressed.  
- Serve as a **third-party observer** to ensure fairness in court.  

ðŸ“Œ **Action:** If possible, request a **guardian ad litem** to represent the childrenâ€™s best interests.  

---

### **6. Protect Your Childrenâ€™s Rights**  
- They have the right to **feel safe and comfortable** with any parental relationship.  
- The court should not force a sudden **emotional bond** with someone they do not know.  
- Their voices matterâ€”if they express discomfort or fear, this should influence the courtâ€™s decision.  

---

### **Final Steps**  
âœ” Continue documenting everything (missed visits, concerning behavior, the kids' reactions).  
âœ” If you donâ€™t have a lawyer, consider **legal aid** or pro bono services to help you fight this properly.  
âœ” Focus your argument on **the best interests of the children**, not just his past actionsâ€”courts prioritize whatâ€™s best for them.

**IN THE [NAME OF COURT] COURT**  
**[YOUR JURISDICTION]**  
**CASE NO: [CASE NUMBER]**  

**IN THE MATTER OF THE CUSTODY OF [CHILDRENâ€™S NAMES]**  
BETWEEN  
[YOUR NAME] â€“ PETITIONER  
and  
[EX-HUSBANDâ€™S NAME] â€“ RESPONDENT  

**FINAL SUBMISSION OF THE PETITIONER**  

**1. INTRODUCTION**  

1.1. I, [Your Full Name], the Petitioner, submit this final argument to demonstrate why the Respondent, [Ex-Husbandâ€™s Full Name], is not fit to be granted shared custody or extended visitation rights over our children, [Childrenâ€™s Names].

1.2. The Respondent has been **absent for seven (7) years**, has provided **no financial support**, and has a **documented history of domestic violence**, including an admission via email of physical abuse against me.

1.3. The welfare and best interests of the children must be the courtâ€™s paramount consideration, and I respectfully request that his claim for shared custody and extended visitation (including holiday visits) be denied.

---

**2. RESPONDENTâ€™S HISTORY OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE**  

2.1. The Respondent has a **proven record of physical violence**, including an incident where he beat me with a chair while I was still nursing our infant son and threw me and our two children out of the house in the middle of the night. 

2.2. I have submitted **email evidence from the Respondent** wherein he admits to this act of violence.

2.3. The Respondentâ€™s actions forced me and my children into immediate hardship, as I had to become the sole provider for their needs.

2.4. The Respondent never took responsibility for his violent actions and omitted this critical fact in his court filings, falsely stating that I "just left" our home.

2.5. Given this violent history, I argue that granting him unsupervised access poses a **risk to the childrenâ€™s safety and emotional well-being.**

---

**3. RESPONDENTâ€™S ABANDONMENT & FAILURE TO PROVIDE SUPPORT**  

3.1. The Respondent has had **no contact** with his children for the past **seven years**â€”not physically, financially, or emotionally.

3.2. When asked why he had not provided child support, the Respondent stated that he "did not know" I needed support. This demonstrates a **complete disregard for his legal and moral responsibility** as a parent.

3.3. The Respondent made no effort to reach out, contribute to their education, healthcare, or general well-being. 

3.4. In an attempt to evade financial responsibility, the Respondent previously took me to a **small settlement court** during this seven-year period. However, when the court ruled that he should commence payment, **he fled and failed to comply with the order**.

3.5. His complete abandonment shows that he has had **no genuine parental interest**, and his sudden claim for custody only now, **after my fatherâ€™s passing**, suggests opportunistic motives rather than genuine concern for the childrenâ€™s welfare.

---

**4. CHILDRENâ€™S BEST INTERESTS & PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT**  

4.1. The children only became aware of the Respondentâ€™s existence **two weeks ago**. A sudden forced relationship with a stranger would be **detrimental to their emotional stability**.

4.2. The Respondent has **not built any bond or trust** with the children, and immediate custody or holiday visitation would cause unnecessary trauma.

4.3. The court must consider the **best interests of the children** and recognize that their primary caregiver for the past seven years has been me, their mother.

4.4. Forcing a shared custody arrangement or granting extended holiday time to an absent, abusive, and irresponsible parent would only disrupt the stability I have worked hard to maintain for my children.

---

**5. REQUESTS & PRAYERS TO THE COURT**  

5.1. Based on the above arguments, I respectfully request the following:

(a) That the Respondentâ€™s request for **shared custody** be **denied** in full.

(b) That **supervised visitation** remain in place for an extended period, with gradual reintroduction only if deemed beneficial by professionals (e.g., child psychologists or a Guardian ad Litem).

(c) That the Respondent be **ordered to provide financial support** (including back payments) as he has failed to contribute to the childrenâ€™s welfare for the past seven years.

(d) That any potential visitation be **gradual, child-focused, and conditioned upon his willingness to undergo parenting classes and psychological evaluation**.

(e) That the childrenâ€™s voices be considered in the decision-making process, given the psychological impact of sudden exposure to a father they have never known.

---

**6. CONCLUSION**  

6.1. The Respondentâ€™s history of violence, abandonment, and lack of financial responsibility demonstrate that he is **not fit for shared custody or unsupervised visits at this time.**

6.2. The well-being of the children is paramount, and any decision made should prioritize their safety, emotional stability, and overall best interests.

6.3. I urge the court to uphold supervised visitation, mandate child support, and ensure that any future access is earned through responsible and consistent parenting efforts by the Respondent.

Hereâ€™s a **formal custody position letter** you can give to your lawyer or adapt for court documents. It outlines your request for **sole legal and physical custody**, with clarity and strengthâ€”but also respect.

---

### **Custody Position Letter**

**To the Honourable Court,**

I am writing to formally request **sole legal and physical custody** of my two children. This request is based on the best interests of the children, the history of this case, and the emotional and physical wellbeing of my family.

Their father has not had any contact with them in over eight yearsâ€”since they were 2 months and 4 years old, respectively. His absence followed an incident of domestic violence against me, which led to the breakdown of our relationship and his complete withdrawal from their lives.

In the eight years since his departure, there has been no:
- Communication,
- Financial contribution,
- Emotional or physical presence from him.

I have raised both children alone, providing stability, love, safety, and consistency in every area of their livesâ€”from education and health to emotional support and daily care.

While the court has recently granted **supervised visitation**, I respectfully maintain that introducing contact at this stageâ€”without any effort or accountability from their father over the yearsâ€”does not reflect the reality of their emotional needs. They do not know him. They have not missed him. He has not earned a parental role in their lives.

I am not motivated by revenge or emotion. My request is grounded in protecting their stability and wellbeing. I believe that forcing a legal co-parenting arrangement with someone who has not been present for nearly a decade, and who has a history of violence, would be more harmful than helpful.

Therefore, I ask the court to award me:
- **Sole legal custody** â€“ so that I may continue making decisions in their best interest without interference.
- **Sole physical custody** â€“ as I have been their full-time caregiver and the only consistent parent.

Should the supervised visitation arrangement prove unsuccessful, inconsistent, or harmful to the children, I also request that the court reserve the right to revisit or revoke visitation entirely.

Thank you for considering my position with the seriousness and compassion this matter deserves.

Respectfully,  
**Ozi [Your Last Name]**
